## Journal File Format

A minimal journal file is a YAML file of the following format:

```yaml
owner: anna
commodities:
  - id: ‚Ç¨
    name: Euro
    alias:
      - EUR
    note: Currency used in the European Union
    utc: '2017-04-02 19:33:53'

entities:
  - id: anna
    name: Anna Smith
    utc: '2017-04-02 19:33:28'
    tags:
      - person
    accounts:
      - id: wallet
        name: Wallet
        note: Anna's black wallet
        utc: '2017-04-02 19:33:28'
        tags:
          - wallet

  - id: evil-corp
    name: Evil Corporation
    utc: '2017-04-02 19:33:28'
    note: The Evil Corporation in the United States of Evil
    tags:
      - company

transactions:
  - title: Purchase of evil machine
    transfers:
      - utc: '2017-02-17'
        from: anna
        to: evil-corp
        amount: 50000 ‚Ç¨
      - utc: '2017-02-17'
        from: evil-corp
        to: anna
        amount: 1 evil-machine
```


## Plotting

By default all accounts are plotted.
To limit it to only a subsection use `awk` to filter the output.

For example all transactions of Euro accounts:

```bash
transity gplot examples/journal.yaml \
| awk '/^$/ || /(EOD|^set terminal)/ || /‚Ç¨/' \
| gnuplot \
| imgcat
```


Or all account balances of Euro accounts over time:

```bash
transity gplot-cumul examples/journal.yaml \
| awk '/^$/ || /(EOD|^set terminal)/ || /‚Ç¨/' \
| gnuplot \
| imgcat
```

![Screenshot of cumulative account balance plot](./images/screenshot-plot.png)


## Import from Ledger CLI

Execute the included ledger2transity script:

```shell
./ledger2transity.sh examples/hledger.journal > transactions.csv
```

Convert `transactions.csv` to YAML with e.g. [browserling.com/tools/csv-to-yaml]

[browserling.com/tools/csv-to-yaml]: https://browserling.com/tools/csv-to-yaml


**Attention:**

- Merge adjacent entries as each entry only debits / credits an account.
  A transaction always involves 2 accounts (`from` and `to`).
  (For expenses basically copy the ledger-account from the second entry
  into the `from` field of the first entry)
- `from` and `to` might reverse for income
  (depending on how the `payee` field was used)
- Account names of Ledger-CLI are interpreted as tags
  Transity understands accounts as **physical accounts**
- The note is duplicated in the `tags` field.
  There is no way to get only the tags in Ledger-CLI üòî


## FAQ

### Why another plain text accounting tool?

Existing accounting tools are historically based on the notion of an account.
You add money (debit) and you remove money (credit).
(If this sounds backwards to you, read [this explanation])

[this explanation]:
  http://simplerestaurantaccounting.com/debit-and-credit-accounting-terminology-is-confusing

For example you get 50 ‚Ç¨ from your mum and buy some food for 20 ‚Ç¨.

```txt
Account | Debit   | Credit
--------|---------|--------
Wallet  | 50.00 ‚Ç¨ |
Wallet  |         | 20.00 ‚Ç¨
---------------------------
```

Simple, but also incomplete.
Where did the money come from, where did it go?
This led to double entry bookkeeping.
Whenever you add some money to an account, you have to remove the same
amount from another.


```txt
Account | Debit   | Credit
--------|---------|--------
Wallet  | 50.00 ‚Ç¨ |
Mum     |         | 50.00 ‚Ç¨
Wallet  |         | 20.00 ‚Ç¨
Food    | 20.00 ‚Ç¨ |
---------------------------
```

But you *must never forget a posting*,
because otherwise your account won't balance.

```txt
Account | Debit   | Credit
--------|---------|--------
Wallet  | 50.00 ‚Ç¨ |
Mum     |         | 50.00 ‚Ç¨
Wallet  |         | 20.00 ‚Ç¨
---------------------------
```

Oops, where did the money go? ü§∑‚Äç

If this looks (and sounds) confusing or too complicated, you're not alone!
It made sense in former times as this layout makes it easier
to add up the amounts by hand, but not in times of computers.

So how can we simplify it?
It's actually quite easy:
We just have to model it in terms of transactions, and not accounts.

```txt
Amount | From   | To
-------|--------|--------
50 ‚Ç¨   | Mum    | Wallet
20 ‚Ç¨   | Wallet | Food
-------------------------
```

- Simple - No more confusing debit / credit / asset / liability mumbo jumbo
- Intuitive - Just like you would talk about it
- Safe - It's obvious if you forget to fill out a field

Together with some further changes it creates an
**easier to understand, more robust and more complete**
representation of accounting!


### Why is it written in PureScript?

PureScript leverages strong static typing and can therefore
give more guarantees about the functionality of the code
than weakly typed or untyped languages (like JavaScript).

You wouldn't want your money to get lost in rounding errors or
be turned to `undefined`, would you? üòâ


### Why is it not written in Haskell?

PureScript can also easily be used in the browser or get deployed
as a cloud function as it simply compiles to JavaScript.
With Haskell you'd have to use another language for a web frontend
or quarrel with experimental stuff like [GHCJS](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs).


## Comparison with Hledger

Checkout the files [hledger.journal] and [journal.yaml]
for similar transactions modeled in Hledger and in Transity.

[hledger.journal]: ./examples/hledger.journal
[journal.yaml]: ./examples/journal.yaml

### Reporting

```shell
hledger --file examples/hledger.journal balance
# vs
transity balance examples/journal.yaml
```

```shell
hledger --file examples/hledger.journal register
# vs
transity transactions examples/journal.yaml
```

```shell
hledger --file examples/hledger.journal register --output-format=csv
# vs
transity entries examples/journal.yaml
```

### Missing features

- Hledger has no first class support for Gnuplot
  (Check out [Report Scripts for Ledger CLI with Gnuplot] for some scripts)

[Report Scripts for Ledger CLI with Gnuplot]:
  https://www.sundialdreams.com/report-scripts-for-ledger-cli-with-gnuplot


## Ideas

### Entry / Value Date

There are no separate fields for entry or value dates necessary.
Simply use ISO 8601 [time intervals] to specify the duration of a transfer.

[time intervals]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals

```yaml
transactions:
  - id: '123456789'
    note: Deposit of savings
    transfers:
      - utc: 2018-01-04T12:00--05T22:10
        from: john
        to: bank
        amount: 100 ‚Ç¨
```


### Syntax

This is a first concept for an alternative syntax for the YAML journal file:

```transity
2016-04-16 18:50:28
#20135604
1 year registration of domain "example.org"
john      -> paypal    :  9.95 ‚Ç¨
paypal    -> namecheap : 10.69 $
paypal    -> icann     :  0.18 $
namecheap -> john      :  1    Domain
```
